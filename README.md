# TFR CSV Viewer
This is a website created for Temple Formula Racing to view the CSV files generated by the car's arduino. The website is hosted on Cloudflare and can be accessed at https://tfr-csv.pages.dev.

The website is built with Next.js and MUI. It utilizes the MUI/X LineChart component heavily to display the data in a user-friendly way.

In the pipeline: 
* When charts have two disparate y-axis series, one series will be displayed along the left y-axis and the other along the right y-axis.
* Uploading the CSV files to a Cloudflare R2 bucket for later retrieval.
* Allowing multiple CSV files to be uploaded and compared.
